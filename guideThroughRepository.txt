GUIDE THROUGH REPOSITORY 
Each lesson is it's own folder. Each folder is then split into two more: 
    - homework - work done by myself at home or homework exercise/split
    - schoolwork - work done during the lectures
There is also "creative-code-notes.txt" folder where I write down things I come into the contact and are unfamiliar with. 
I only have one index file and based on which script I need, I change script source(src) in it.
